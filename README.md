Final deliverable of cs-330 course
## Description
This project was a stepping stone in furthering knowledge in C++ language and incorperating the libraries included in OPENGL in order to gain skills in 3d and 2d modeling/rendering in programming. There is many different methods needed to properly render in a scene and it was fun to learn the process


How do I approach designing software?
- I approach designing software by analyzing larger themes or requirements and using regression to break them into smaller and more managable elements.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
- It has helped me furthering my modularization of codebase to make it more digestable and understandable. It also allows for easier implementation of improvements or changes futher on in development.
  
What design process did you follow for your project work?
- I followed a simple design process of declarations followed by methodology in order to contain elements to respective methods easier and make codebase more navigatable.
